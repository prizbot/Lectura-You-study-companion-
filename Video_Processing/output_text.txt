What is Data Science?


 



- Read data

- Data processing and cleaning
- Summarizing data

- Visualization

- Deriving insights irom data


 
Data perspective


 


- Python libraries provide key feature sets which are essential for ma science
om manipulation and pre-processing

Pydlon's‘pandas' library oﬂers 2 variety ellunenons for an wrangling
and manipulation

- Data summary

Visualization

Plotting libraries like ‘matplotll and ‘sezborn' aid in condensing statistical

inlormarlon and help In identifying trends and relationships
Machine learning libraries like ‘sci-kl: learn’ oﬂer a bouquet ol machi
learning algorithms


 
Data science using Python


 



 
Advantages of Python

- Provides good ecosystem of libraries that are robust
and varied

- Tight knit integration with big data frameworks like
Hadoop, Spark etc

- Supports both object oriented and functional
programming paradigms

- Python is reasonably last to prototype

- Provides support for reading files from local,
databases and cloud
